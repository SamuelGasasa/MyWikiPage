            <p class="ptext">Typhon was the last son of GAIA, fathered by Tartarus, he was known as the “Father of All Monsters”. Instead of a human head, a hundred dragon heads erupted from Typhon's neck and shoulders. His wife ECHIDNA, half woman half snake, was likewise the “Mother of All Monsters.”

                Together, Echidna and Typhon raised some of the most well known monsters and creatures in all mythology.</p>
